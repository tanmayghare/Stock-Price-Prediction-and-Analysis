# Stock Price Prediction:
(Refer stock_price_prediction_ML_model.py)

Built a Machine Learning model based on a multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for predicting future stock price movements using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

# Stock Price Analysis:
(Refer stock_price_analysis.py & stock_price_statistics.py)

Performed regression analysis to investigate and analyze stock indicators which indeed gave us insights on how stock prices react on significant corporate event dates and non-event dates, thus helping investors for making better data-driven investment decisions. Stock indicators were regressed and observed.
