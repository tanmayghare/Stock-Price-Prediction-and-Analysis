# Stock Price Prediction and Analysis

## Prediction:

Built a Machine Learning model based on a multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for predicting future stock price movements using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

## Analysis:

Performed regression analysis to investigate and analyze stock indicators which indeed gave us insights on how stock prices react on significant corporate event dates and non-event dates, thus helping investors for making better data-driven investment decisions. Stock indicators were regressed and observed.

## Statistics:

Performed statistical analysis on the stock price data. This includes calculating various statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other relevant metrics to gain insights into the stock price movements and trends.
