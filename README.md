# Stock Price Prediction and Analysis
A Machine Learning model for predicting future stock price movements.

Built a Machine Learning model based on a multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for predicting future stock price movements using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

Performed regression analysis to investigate and analyze stock indicators on significant corporate event dates and non-event dates.

Tech stack: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
